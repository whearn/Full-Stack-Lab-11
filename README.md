# Lab 11: Learn You Node
## Due: Tuesday, June 13th
##### Covalence
###### Full Stack: Summer 2017

## Info
* This lab will make use of a Terminal-based workshop
* The workshop exercises will give you experience with basic Node functions
* Some of the assigned exercises mention 3rd party modules you can install and use
    * Do not install the 3rd party modules. Do the exercise using built-in Node core modules.
    * Once you get an exercise right, you can make another file and try it using the 3rd party module if you'd like.

## Setup
* This lab uses a global node module
* To install it, use this command at the command line:
```
npm install -g learnyounode
```
* Then, to run the workshop, make sure your terminal window is focused on your project folder and run this command:
```
learnyounode
```

* Navigate up and down using the arrow keys on your keyboard
* Press enter to select a workshop

* The workshop simply displays this information. To complete an exercise, open your project folder in VS Code and create a new file named after the exercise (e.g. http-file-server.js).
* Then, to get the workshop to check your file for correctness, use this command in the terminal:
```
learnyounode verify file-to-check.js
```
